This repository contains my personal project based on the book *Zero to Production in Rust* by Luca Palmieri. It's a journey through backend development using Rust, aiming to create robust, efficient, and maintainable web applications. This example is an email newsletter service that allows users to subscribe to a newsletter and receive daily emails with the latest news. It is implemented using the [Actix-Web](https://actix.rs/) framework and [SQLx](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/) database library.

## About the Project 📘

The project follows the book's guidelines to develop a backend application in Rust. It involves setting up a Rust environment, exploring its unique features, and learning best practices for web development. This is a hands-on approach to understanding Rust in a real-world setting.

### Current Status ⏳

- [x] Initial setup and environment configuration
- [x] Basic REST API structure
- [ ] Database integration
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Deployment and scaling
- [ ] Continuous integration and testing

*Note: The project is currently in progress and more features will be added continuously.*

## Learning Outcomes 🎓

- In-depth understanding of Rust's syntax and features
- Experience with backend development practices
- Knowledge of RESTful API design
- Familiarity with database management in Rust
- Insights into deploying and maintaining Rust applications
